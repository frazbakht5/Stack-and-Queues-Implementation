# Stack-and-Queues-Implementation
This project implements minStack and Priority Queue as asked in the requirements below:

1) Describe the meaning of the essential methods add(x), deleteMin(), and size() that are supported by the priority queue interface. Implement those methods using a singly-linked list. Analyze the running time of the add(x) and deletMin() operations based on this implementation.

2) Implement the stack methods push(x) and pop() using two queues. Analyze the running time of the push(x) and pop() operations based on this implementation

3) Swap two adjacent elements in a list by adjusting only the links (and not the data) using:
  a. singly-linked list
  b. doubly-linked list
  
4) Design and implement a MinStack data structure that can store comparable elements and supports the stack operations push(x), pop(), and size(), as well as the min() operation, which returns the minimum value currently stored in the data structure. All operations should run in constant time.

5) Write a method, reverse(), that reverses the order of elements in a DLList.
